# 
# Write a function called guessingGame, this function will take two integers,
# an upper and lower bound, and return nothing. If the first parameter is 
# greater than the second parameter, print "Error, incorrect input". Otherwise
# print "I'm thinking of a random number between (lower_bound) and (upper_bound), guess
# the number!" then continually prompt the user for a number until the number is 
# guessed. 
# Use the python random library to help you
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
# 
# Extra: import the text crawl function and implement it in this function.
