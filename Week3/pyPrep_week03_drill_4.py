#       In mathematics, a factorial is defined as the product of an integer and all the integers below it
#       For instance, 4 factorial would be the product of 1 * 2 * 3 * 4.
#       Write a program that takes an integer from a user and then finds the factorial of that number
#       (hint: you will need a 'for loop')
