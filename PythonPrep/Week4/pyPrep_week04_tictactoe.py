# 
# In this assignment we will be coding our our own tic-tac-toe game.
# First initalize a list that contains 9 strings. This will be our board for the rest of the game
# 
# Next we need to write code to print the board.
# 
# Now we need to create a way for our players to play the game. Ask player one where they would like
# to place an X, their answer must be an index of the board, which is to say 0 - 8 
# When they've answered replace the string at the desired index with an 'X'.
# 
# Write the same code for player two but with a 'O'.
# 
# Finally, write a while True loop, and paste your player one code and your player two code.
# I would also recommend pasting your code that prints the board inbetween each player's turn.
