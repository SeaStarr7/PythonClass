#       In the united states you must be 18 years old or older to vote in an election
#       Write a program that asks the user for their age, if their age is greater than 120, print
#       "how are you not dead?", if their age is greater or equal to 18 print "You can vote"
#       if their age is less than 18 print "too young to vote". Only one of these cases may be true
