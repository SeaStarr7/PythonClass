# Dipper is looking for a mysterious creature in the Gravity Falls forest. He read in the journal that this creature
# only comes out if the temperature is between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The forest starts to cool off as
# the sun goes down. So, he wants to monitor the temperature. Unfortunately, he left his thermometer back at
# the Mystery Shack.
# Dipper remembers that the crickets in the forest chirp faster when it is hot outside and slower when it is
# cold outside. In fact there is a formula to calculate the temperature given the number of times the cricket
# chirps in a 13 second interval. Take the number of chirps you count from the cricket in 13 seconds, then add
# 40. You will have an approximation of the temperature in Fahrenheit.
# Luckily, Dipper has a stopwatch and his laptop with Python installed.


# Help Dipper by writing a program that will prompt him for the number of chirps he counted in 13 seconds,
# calculating the temperature, then display the temperature. Except, if the temperature is less than 55
# degrees, instead display a message that states that it is too cold for crickets.


# Sample 1
# ==================================================
# Hey Dipper, I'll calculate the temperature for you.
# Using your stopwatch, count how many times the
# cricket chirps in 13 seconds.
# How many chirps did you count? 46
# By my calculations it is about 86 degrees.
# ==================================================

# Sample 2
# ==================================================
# Hey Dipper, I'll calculate the temperature for you.
# Using your stopwatch, count how many times the
# cricket chirps in 13 seconds.
# How many chirps did you count? 13
# It's too cold for crickets.
