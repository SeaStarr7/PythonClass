#       For some reason your mom decided to use python dictionary as a grocery list.
#       Write a function called momsGroceries which takes an empty dictionary, and returns it
#       Take the passed in dictionary and add 1 gallon of milk, 4 eggs, and 2 loafs of bread.
#       The items will be your keys and the quantities will be your values.
